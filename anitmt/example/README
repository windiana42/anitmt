+ test/:    stupid test example
+ myrobot/: moving robots (scalar animation)
+ circles/: rotating circles with anitmt in the middle
(anitmt in the middle is switched off by default, as it needs a lot of time to render)

mpeg.par:  example parameter file for mpeg2encode

make_examples: In order to render all example animations you can run the make_examples script
(this may take some hours)
clean_examples: Attention! removes all rendered files in the animation directories of the examples
