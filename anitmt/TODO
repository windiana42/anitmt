some things to do (not complete at all)

Martin:
- Prop_Tree_Node::get_possible_children()
- optimization of Prop_Tree_Node::get_properties_names()
- Test functions for anything
- destruction of operator trees (with constant operands)

Wolfgang:
- Better POVRay support (yes, done when I can work with anitmt 
  so that I can effectively test things). 
- Clean up frame output code (better done when we implement the 
  new output concept). 
- Parameter subsystem [...]
- More to come...
