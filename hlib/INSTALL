As of version 1.1.0, hlib can be installed using 

  make install

after a successful build. 

This will install all the headers in $prefix/include/hlib/ (i.e. in a 
separate subdir called hlib/ so that the headers won't collide with other 
headers and that one can still use #include <hlib/xxx.h>) and the static 
library archive in $prefix/lib/libhlib.a. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can, however, still use the pre-1.1.0 method and install per hand: 

Put all the required header files (see $builddir/include/hlib) 
into a subdirectory (e.g. /usr/include/hlib) and copy the library 
to some convenient place (/usr/lib if you like). 

Of course, the easiest way is to symlink 
/usr/include/hlib -> $builddir/include/hlib
(and the same for the library). 

I recommend using 
  #include <hlib/xyz.h>
in your code in order to prevent name collision with some other xyz.h. 
(This is the reason why you should put all the headers into a 
directory named "hlib").
