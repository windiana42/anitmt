* Generate example films
------------------------
	You can find three example films in the example/ directory
	They may be generated after build process as follows:

	cd example/myrobot/
	../../anitmt-calc/anitmt-calc myrobot.ini
	cd ani/
	../../../utils/render -w 400 -h 300
	../../../utils/tga2avi -e 336 -f 24

	This generates a film.avi file with 336 frames and 24 frames per second. 
	The parameters of tga2avi should correspond to the options in myrobot.ini
	Attention: not all options of myrobot.ini take effekt they should be passed 
	  to film generation tools like render and tga2avi automatically in the future

	the example/test_examples script generates small versions of the three example
	films like described
