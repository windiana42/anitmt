0. INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library is intended to provide low-level routines dealing with 
scalars, vectors and matrices. 

Lots of functions are available as member functions (methods) and 
non-member functions (called friends here). 
The purpose is mostly the same: While methods change their object 
(*this), friends do not. 
I always use the same style: A methods and its corresponding friend 
has the same function name; the friend takes one additional argument 
(always the first argument; it is the one which the method uses *this 
instead). While the member function usually returns a reference to *this, 
the friends normally return a new object (allocated on the stack, of 
course). This often makes the methods faster. Examples: 
Method:                          Friend:
Vector &normalize();             Vector normalize(const Vector &v);
Vector &trans(double d,int i);   Vector trans(const Vector &v,double d,int i);


1. NEUTRAL0, NEUTRAL1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neutral0 and Neutral1 implement addition and multiplication neutral types. 

You can construct scalars, vectors, matrices and strings with type Neutral0 
and compare them against Neutral0. (Scalar 0.0 the null vector and the 
null matrix correspond to Neutral0.) 

You can construct scalars and matrices with type Neutral1 and compare them 
against Neutral1. (Scalar 1.0 and the identity matrix  correspond to 
Neutral1.)


2. SCALAR
~~~~~~~~~~

Scalar implements a single floating point value. 
Scalar::get_type() returns Valtype::scalar 
(of type enum Valtype::Types). 

Constructors: 
  * Scalar(double s)  constructs a scalar containing the value i. 
  * Scalar()          constructs a scalar set up to 0.0 .
  * The copy constructor is implemented. 

Operators:
  > Assignment: 
      * The assignment operator is implemented (operator=)
  > Conversion:
      * A Scalar is implicitly converted to a double by 
        operator double(). 
  > Comparison:
      * Scalars can be compared to scalars and to double values. 
        Both possibilities (Scalar,double) and (double,Scalar) are 
        implemented. 
      * Both the operators == and != are implemented. 
      * The logical not (operator!()) returns true (1), if the 
        scalar is 0. 
      * All comparisons use the global value vect::epsilon: 
        If two scalars a and b should be compared, they are considered 
        equal, if  fabs(a-b)<=epsilon . 
        NOTE that this might not be what you want, if you are comparing 
             two really big values as their difference will almost 
             certainly be larger than epsilon. 
  > Arithmetics: 
      * Operators for +=, -=, *= and /= are implemented taking a 
        double as their argument. 
        As a Scalar gets implicitly converted to a double, all other 
        arithmetical operators (+,-,*,/) need not be implemented. 
  > Output: 
      * A scalar can be written to a stream using the usual stream 
        operator taking a double argument. 


3. VECTOR
~~~~~~~~~~

Vector<R> implements a R-dimensional (row) vector. 

Constructors: 
  * Vecror()       constructs a null vector. 
  * Vector(x,y,z)  constructs a vector set up to x,y,z. 
  * The copy constructor is implemented. 

Operators:
  > Assignment: 
      * The assignment operator is implemented (operator=)
  > Conversion:
      * There is no implicit conversion implemented. 
  > Access/Modification:
      * The elements of the vector can be accessed via operator[]. 
        The passed argument must be of an integer type; 0 refers to 
        the x component, 2 to the z component. 
        NOTE: For speed increase, there is no range check performed 
              on the argument. 
      * The elements of the vector can not be set via operator[]. 
        To set an element, use operator()(i,val). 
        The first argument (integer type) specifies the element index 
        of the component to be modified (0 -> x .. 2 -> z), the second 
        argument is the new value for the component. 
  > Comparison:
      * Vectors can be compared to other vectors. 
      * Both operator!= and operator== are implemented. 
      * The operators use vect::epsilon (see Scalar/Comparison). 
      * Operator!() returns true (1) if the vector *this is the null vector. 
        Alternatively, you can use the method is_null(). 
  > Arithmetics: 
      * Vectors can be added to and subtracted from vectors. 
        Both operator+/operator- and operator+=/operator-= are implemented. 
      * The unary + and - operators are implemented; operator+() just 
        returns *this. 
      * Given a vector, you cannot add/subtract a scalar. 
      * Vectors can be multiplied with and divided by scalars. 
        Both operator*,operator/ and operator*=,operator/= are implemented. 
      * Two vectors can be multiplied in two different ways: 
      -- scalar multiplication --
        Operator* implements the scalar multiplication (resulting in a 
        Scalar) just as the function 
        Scalar dot(Vector,Vector). 
      -- vector multiplication --
        The vector product is calculated by cross(). 
        You can use the member function 
        Vector &Vector::cross(const Vector &b) 
          which multiplies *this with b, stores the result in *this and 
          returns *this
        or you can use the friend
        Vector cross(const Vector &a,const Vector &b)
          which calculates the vector product of a and b and returns it. 
      * You can multiply a Vector with a Matrix resulting in a Vector. 
        For this purpose, operator*(Matrix,Vector), operator*(Vector,Matrix) 
        and Vector::operator*=(Matrix) are implemented. 
        NOTE that the member operator (*=) is not faster than the friends 
             as it needs a temporary. 
  > Output: 
      * The output stream operator << is implemented. The vector (x,y,z) 
        is written as <x,y,z> (povray notation). [MIGHT BE CHANGED]

Functions: 
  > Length: 
       * Method abs() returns the length of the vector *this as a double, 
         abs2() returns the square of its length (which is much faster as 
         no sqrt() has to be calculated). 
       * To get a Scalar as result, you can use the friends abs(Vector) 
         and abs2(Vector). 
       * normalize() stretches the vector so that the resulting vector 
         has the length 1. 
         You can use the method normalize() to normalize *this, or 
         you can use the friend Vector normalize(Vector) which does not 
         modify the passed vector. 
  > Angle: 
       * To calculate the angle between two vectors, you can use angle(). 
         This function returns the angle as Scalar in range 0...PI 
         (i.e. 0...180 degrees and NOT 0...90 degrees). 
         There are two versions of the function: 
         The method angle(Vector b) returns the angle between *this and b, 
         the friend angle(Vector a,Vector b) calculates the angle between 
         the vectors a and b. 
  > Translation: 
       * The function trans() can be used to translate a vector. 
         Both methods and friends are available for this job (see the 
         introduction on the difference between them). 
         The translation method takes two arguments: trans(double d,int xyz)
         d is the value to be added to the vector component indexed xyz 
         (in range 0...2 with no range check). 
         v.trans(d,xyz) or trans(v,d,xyz) is like adding d to v[xyz]. 
  > Scalation: 
       * As for translation, there are also functions to scale the vector. 
         Both methods and friends are available (see the introduction on 
         the difference between them). 
         The method scale(double f,int xyz) takes two arguments: 
         xyz selects the component to multiply with f. 
  > Mirror: 
       * The mirror function mirror(int xyz) (available as member and as 
         friend) changes the sign of the component indexed by xyz (in range 
         0...2 with no range check). 
       * The method mirror(void) changes the sign of all components (like 
         unary operator-). 
  > Rotation:
       * Three methods for basic rotation are provided: 
         rotateX(), rotateY(), rotateZ(). They all take one argument 
         specifying the angle of rotation (in radians, of course). 
         There are methods and friends available. 
  > Coordinate conversion: 
       * The methods to_spherical() and to_rectangular() can be used to 
         convert the coordinates (changing the content of the vector 
         components, of course): to_spherical() converts a vector in 
         rectangular notation to spherical notation; to_rectangular() 
         does right the opposite. Thus, to_rectangular(to_spherical(v))=v. 
       * There are members and friends available (the friends are slower). 
       * The rectangular coordinates are stored as x,y,z; the spherical 
         ones as r,phi,theta:
           [0]  x    r
           [1]  y   phi
           [2]  z  theta


4. MATRIX
~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix<C,R> implements a RxC-matrix. 

Constructors: 
  * Matrix()               constructs an identity-matrix. 
  * Matrix(Matrix::ident)  also sets up an identity-matrix. 
  * Matrix(Matrix::null)   constructs a null-matrix (all elements 0). 
  * The copy constructor is implemented. 

Operators: 
  > Assignment:
      * The assignment operator is implemented (operator=)
  > Conversion:
      * There is no implicit conversion implemented. 
  > Access/Modification:
      * The elements of the matrix can be accessed via 2x operator[]. 
        Matrix::operator[](int c) returns the matrix column indexed c 
        as a vect::matrix_column<3>; its operator[](int r) returns the 
        double value in row r in the column. 
        The passed column/row index must be in range 0...2; there is no 
        range check performed. 
        Example: mat[0][2] returns the element of mat at column 0 and 
                 row 2. 
        NOTE: THE FIRST ARGUMENT IS THE COLUMN (X-direction), THE SECOND 
              ONE IS THE ROW (Y-direction). 
      * The elements of the vector can not be set via operator[]. 
        To set an element, use operator()(c,r,val). 
        The first argument specifies the column index, the second one 
        the row index of the component to be modified, the third argument 
        is the new value for the component. 
  > Comparison:
      * You can compare a matrix to another one. The matrices are simply 
        compared component-wise with respect to vect::epsilon. 
      * Both operator== and operator!= are implemented. 
      * operator!() and is_ident() return true, if the matrix is the 
        identity matrix (with respect to vect::epsilon). 
      * is_null() returns true if the matrix is the null-matrix (with 
        respecto to vect::epsilon). 
  > Arthmetics: 
      * Matrices can be added to and subtracted from matrices. 
        This is done by adding/subtracting the element of one matrix to/from 
        the corresponding one in the other matrix. 
        Both operator+/operator- and operator+=/operator-= are implemented. 
      * The unary + and - operators are implemented; operator+() just 
        returns *this, operator- changes the sign of every matrix element. 
    -- Matrix and Scalar: --
      * A Matrix can be multiplied with a Scalar, resulting in a Matrix. 
        The multiplication is done by multiplying every matrix element 
        with the scalar. 
        Both operator*(Matrix,Scalar) and operator*(Scalar,Matrix) are 
        implemented. 
      * You can divide a matrix by a scalar; this works like the 
        multiplication. Note that you cannot divide a scalar by a matrix. 
      * For scalars operator*= and operator/= are implemented. 
    -- Matrix and Vector: --
      * A matrix can be multiplied with a vector resulting in a vector: 
        see the vector section for that. 
    -- Matrix and Matrix: --
      * You may multiply a Matrix with a Matrix resulting in a Matrix. 
        Both operator* and operator*= are implemented; due to the temporary, 
        the method is not faster than the friend. 

Functions: 
  > Inversion: 
      * A matrix can be inverted using the invert() function available as 
        mathod and as friend. 
        (If you multiply a matrix and the inverse matrix the result is the 
        identity matrix.)
      * Inversion is done using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm (elegant and 
        exact). 
  > Matrix Construction: 
      * You may construct matrices for scaling using MscaleX(), MscaleY(), 
        MscaleZ(). Each of these functions takes a double argument being 
        the scale factor. 
        You may also use Mscale(Vector) using x,y,z from the vector. 
      * You may construct matrices for rotation around an axis using 
        MrotateX(), MrotateY(), MrotateZ(). The double argument is the 
        rotation ange (in radians, of course). 
        You may also use Mrotate(Vector) using x,y,z angles from the vector. 
        in the given order (x, then y, then z). 
      * You may construct matrices for translation using MtranslateX(), 
        MtranslateY() and MtranslateZ(). 
        You may also use Mtranslate(Vector) using x,y,z from the vector. 
      * To rotate around the x, the y and the z axis in this order, you 
        may use Mrotate(Vector v). The elements of the vector specify the 
        rotation angles. 
      * Mrotate_around(Vector,angle) constructs a matrix for a rotation 
        around the specified vector. angle is the rotation angle. 
      * Mrotate_vect_vect(Vector from,to) rotates the first vector to 
        the second and returns the rotation matrix which can do that. 
	(may be done in different ways...)
      * Mrotate_vect_vect_up(Vector from,to,up) rotates the first vector 
        to the second by first rotating around up vector (third arg)
      * Mrotate_pair_pair(Vector from_front,from_up,to_front,to_up) 
	rotates the first vector pair to the second
      * Mrotate_spherical_pair(Vector front,up,angles) the components of angles
	specify the rotation angles around front-, up- and cross(front,up)-axis
      * get_scale_component(Matrix m) returns a vector which tells the resulting
        scalation of an x,y and z vector when multipied with Matrix m.
	To reproduce the effet of m, scale, then rotate and finally translate
      * get_rotation_component(Matrix m) returns a vector representing the
	rotation around the x, y and finally the z axis that are done to a 
        vector when being multiplied with the Matrix m.
	To reproduce the effet of m, scale, then rotate and finally translate
      * get_translate_component(Matrix m) returns the position independant 
	translation as vector, that is done to a vector when being multipied 
	with the Matrix m
	To reproduce the effet of m, scale, then rotate and finally translate


5. FLAG
~~~~~~~

Flag implements a simple bool true/false value. 


6. STRING
~~~~~~~~~

String implements a simple string and is publically derived 
from std::string to be easy to use with all the STL string 
operations.
