Installing RendView
-------------------

NOTE: I do NOT recomment using "make install". 

Better install rendview manually. That is simple: 
After a successful build, log in as root and copy the binary 
builddir/src/rendview where you would like to have it (maybe /usr/local/bin). 
If you want to use the remote admin shell, also copy adminshell/rvadminshell 
into some installation directory (/usr/local/bin or so). 
That's all. RendView is now "installed". 
You may consider stripping the binary (using strip). 

Also read the docu about config files and how to launch RendView. 
You may try "rendview --help" if you want to see why reading the quick 
start in the docu is necessary...

Enjoy... (and don't forget to report bugs you find, see README).
